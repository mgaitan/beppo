Beppo Interactive Learning System
---------------------------------

Beppo is an interactive whiteboard that allows tutors to give 
online classes, and provides hours tracking for clients (educative 
organizations) to know how many hours of class they have used. 
It also provides a web interface to configure user accounts 
for tutors, clients, pupils.

It supports instant access classes, pre-arranged classes, 
and offline questions. After every class the contents of the whiteboard 
are saved in the backend's database and can be later post-processed 
by a tutor, and sent via mail to the pupil or to a pre-configured 
mail account.

It's mainly designed for giving maths classes, and has a couple of 
helpful features for this.

Beppo is named after `Beppo Levi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppo_Levi>`_, 
a renouned mathematician.

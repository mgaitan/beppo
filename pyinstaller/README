This directory contains a .spec file to build a Win32 executable containing
Beppo's whiteboard.

Before you build the executable you need to make sure that:

 - You have Python2.4 installed

 - You have UPX installed.  You can get UPX from http://upx.sourceforge.net/
   Make sure it's in your execution path!

 - You have Mark Hammond's Python for Windows extensions installed, from
   http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/

 - PyInstaller's svn head revision is downloaded and configured.  To configure
   PyInstaller, run in a terminal:
   C:\Path\to\python.exe C:\Path\to\PyInstaller\Configure.py

 - Beppo's svn trunk is located in C:\svn\beppo (so you have a file called
   C:\svn\beppo\beppo\client\Login.py, for example). If not, edit the
   spec file accordingly.

Finally, you can build the executable by running:

C:\Path\to\python.exe C:\Path\to\pyinstaller\Build.py C:\svn\beppo\pyinstaller\beppo.spec

That's it!  You should have an beppo.exe file now.

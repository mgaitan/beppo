This directory contains a .spec file to build a Win32 executable containing
Beppo's whiteboard.

Before you build the executable you need to make sure that:

 - You have Python2.4 installed

 - You have UPX installed.  You can get UPX from http://upx.sourceforge.net/
   Make sure it's in your execution path!

 - You have Mark Hammond's Python for Windows extensions installed, from
   http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/

 - PyInstaller's svn head revision is downloaded and configured.
   You can download PyInstaller's svn head using:
   svn co http://svn.pyinstaller.python-hosting.com/trunk pyinstaller
   To configure PyInstaller, run in a terminal:
   C:\Path\to\python.exe C:\Path\to\pyinstaller\Configure.py

 - Beppo's svn trunk is located in C:\svn\beppo (so you have a file called
   C:\svn\beppo\beppo\client\Login.py, for example). If not, edit the
   spec file accordingly.

Finally, you can build the executable by running:

C:\Path\to\python.exe C:\Path\to\pyinstaller\Build.py C:\svn\beppo\pyinstaller\beppo.spec

That's it!  You should have an beppo.exe file now.

===================
Building the spec file is really easy if you don't want to use the one provided.

This README is based on http://pyinstaller.hpcf.upr.edu/docs/Manual_v1.1.html

When you get to the step of creating the spec file, the options that were used
by me were:

-F -K -w -X -p <path/to/python/libs> -n beppo
